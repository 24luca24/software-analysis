# software-analysis
As a student of software analysis course, I would like to share what we did and what technologies we used in this  course. 
I this course we will have 3 assignment to do, regarding different software analysis technique

## Assignment 1: algorithm analysis with Dafny
Dafny is a formal static verification tool that allows you to write and verify programs with mathematical guarantees. It supports specifications like preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants.
The aim of this assignment was to get hands-on practice with the tool by analyzing algorithms such as selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, and mergesort.
